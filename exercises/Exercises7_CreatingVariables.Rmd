We'll continue to work on the same .Rmd file from the previous exercise.

## 7.1 Create a New Variable

1. Write a brief note using Markdown syntax that mentions we'll be investigating the name George in more detail and that we'll be creating a new variable that represents the change year to year.  

2. Use the `BabyNamesFull` data object and filter the data to only contain observations where `sex` is `M` and the name is `George`.  

3. Create a new variable using `mutate()` that is the difference from year to year for the `count` variable.  This can be done using the `lag()` function via `count-lag(count)`.  Call this variable `diff`.
