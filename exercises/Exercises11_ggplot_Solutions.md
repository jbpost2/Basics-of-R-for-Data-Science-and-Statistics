Exercises 11 - ggplot Solutions
================

Weâ€™ll continue to work on the same .Rmd file from the previous exercise.

# 11.1

1.  Use the data object created by the code below to create a line plot
    (via \`geom\_line()) that looks like the one below.

``` r
names <- c("Justin", "George", "Alexander", "Jacob", "Anderson")
lineData <- BabyNamesFull %>%
  filter(name %in% names) %>% 
  group_by(name, year) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'name'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
ggplot(lineData) +
 aes(x = year, y = total, color = name) +
 geom_line() +
 scale_color_hue()
```
