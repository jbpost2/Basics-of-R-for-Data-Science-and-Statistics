Exercises 10 - Bar Plots
================

We’ll continue to work on the same .Rmd file from the previous exercise.

1.  Filter the data by the names of interest we have, group the data by
    name, and find the total counts using the code below:

``` r
names <- c("Justin", "George", "Alexander", "Jacob", "Anderson")
barData <- BabyNamesFull %>%
  filter(name %in% names) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count))
```

2.  Use the data object created to create a bar plot with names on the
    x-axis and the total count on the y-axis. You’ll need to specify
    both the x and y variables and change the statistic to “identity” in
    the `geom_bar()` function.

3.  Use the data object created by the code below to create a filled bar
    plot with the sex variable denoting the coloring of columns.

``` r
barDataSex <- BabyNamesFull %>%
  filter(name %in% c("Shannon", "Lindsay", "Avery")) %>% 
  group_by(name, sex) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'name'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
