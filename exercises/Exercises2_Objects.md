Exercises 2 - Objects
================

## 2.1 Creating R Objects

1.  The code below creates a vector of three character strings (more on
    vectors shortly). Use this code and the ‘storage arrow’ to create an
    object names `adj`.

`c("scary","intelligent","new")`

2.  Similarly, create an object called `nouns` using the storage arrow
    and code below.

`c("bugs", "beings", "houses")`

3.  The `paste()` function is useful for combining character strings.
    After completing the above parts, run the following:

`paste(adj, nouns)`

## 2.2 Investigating Objects

1.  `iris` is a built-in R object (that means you have it in your
    environment even if it doesn’t show it). Determine the `class` and
    structure (`str`) of the `iris` object.

2.  Run the code below to create a quick visual of this dataset. Note
    that R is determining what to do with the `plot()` function based on
    the object given to it!

`plot(iris)`
