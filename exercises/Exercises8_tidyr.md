# 8.1 Widening Data

1.  We are going to ‘widen’ that data by taking the observations for the
    names ‘Shannon’ and ‘Lindsay’ and make one row that has the counts
    for both `M` and `F` observations. Add a brief section of text
    corresponding to this goal.

2.  Filter the `BabyNamesFull` data object to only include the names
    ‘Shannon’ and ‘Lindsay’. Then use the `pivot_wider()` function to
    create a wider data set as noted above.
